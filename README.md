# LH Stinger Toolhead for the Neptune 4 Pro

Just a brain dump for now....

## Notes
For the most part, you will be following the BOM and build instructions of the existing LH toolhead. The remix I am presenting allows you to mount it on the 4 Pro carriage and use the Elegoo breakout board.

You don't need Open Neptune for this. 

You will need to buy parts. 

You will have the freedom to choose which parts you want to use.

No, I am not going to walk you through the build process. [LH has already done that](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger/wiki/Toolhead).

## Why is this even necessary?
It's not. The Elegoo toolhead with Lamarc's and Frosted's fan modifications work just fine. I would suggest to save your money on other mods.

## Then why do it?
I wanted a filament cutter after the extruder. This is not possible with the stock Elegoo toolhead.

I like to tinker.

I wanted to have fun.
