# LH Stinger Toolhead for the Neptune 4 Pro

Just a brain dump for now....

## Notes
For the most part you will be following the BOM and build instructions of the existing LH toolhead. The remix I am presenting allow you to mount it on the 4 Pro carriage and use the Elegoo breakout board.

You don't need Open Neptune for this. 

You will need to buy parts. 

You will have the freedom to choose which parts you want to use.

No I am not going to walk you through the build process. [LH has already done that](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger/wiki/Toolhead).
