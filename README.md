# LH Stinger Toolhead for the Neptune 4 Pro

Just a brain dump for now....

## Notes
For the most part, you will be following the BOM and build instructions of the existing LH toolhead. The remix I am presenting allows you to mount it on the 4 Pro carriage and use the Elegoo breakout board.

You don't need Open Neptune for this. 

You will need to buy parts. 

You will have the freedom to choose which parts you want to use.

No, I am not going to walk you through the build process. [LH has already done that](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger/wiki/Toolhead).

## Why is this even necessary?
It's not. 

The Elegoo toolhead with Lamarc's and Frosted's fan modifications work just fine. I would suggest to save your money on other mods.

## Then why do it?
I wanted a filament cutter after the extruder. This is not possible with the stock Elegoo toolhead.

I like to tinker.

I wanted to have fun.

## What to expect with this remix
- This uses LDO Orbitor v2.5 (same plate as v2.0) extruder. If you want to use the sherpa, or some other you will need to remix from the LH repo and copy the bolt pattern over. 
- You will need to use a riser between the toolhead frame and the extruder. This is to make it over the rail and the wheels.
- This remix has a mount for the BTT Eddy. A future version will have this as optional.
- You may need a spacer between the hotend and the ceiling of the toolframe. You can scale this as needed.
